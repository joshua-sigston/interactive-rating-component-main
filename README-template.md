Lessons learned:
  Had to due some research on disabling buttons after an other button was clicked. Really did not find much help except for answers invovling jQuery. Did want to step aside and take a crash course into jQuery so I used the elements classlists to figure this enigma out. If there is a better way please let me know.

  Thank You.
